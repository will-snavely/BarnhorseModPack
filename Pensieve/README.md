# Pensieve
Remember your cherished Spire memories.

## About
Pensieve is a mod for Slay the Spire that seeks
to provide a more complete run historyâ€”as complete
as possible. For example:
- Recording what happened on each individual turn.
- Recording when relics were triggered.
- Tracking information about individual cards.

## Installing

Pensieve is currently only available on Github.
You should head to the 
[Releases](https://github.com/will-snavely/BarnhorseModPack/releases)
page and download the latest version of `Pensive.jar`.
This should then be placed in the `mods` folder of
your Slay the Spire installation directory (if you 
are using Steam, you can find this by right-clicking
the game, and navigating to "Manage", then selecting
"Browse Local Files").

## Enabling

To use the mod, you must launch Slay the Spire with mods enabled, 
then ensure that "Pensieve" is selected in the mod configuation
dialog.

## Run Data
The mod will record data for each run it observes under
the `etc/barnhorse/pensieve/runs` folder within your
Slay the Spire `mods` folder. The currently active 
run should appear directly in the `runs` folder, 
and previous runs can be found in the `archives`
directory. Run files are named: `<seed>_<class>.run`,
for example `3Q3XW9132VY83_IRONCLAD.run`. Archived
runs have a slightly different naming scheme:
`<seed>_<class>_<timestamp>_archive.run`, where
`<timestamp>` reflects when the run was archived.

## Viewing the Run Data
There is currently no integration with the Slay the Spire client,
though this might be done in the future. Therefore, to view the 
run data, you currently must consider the following options:

1. The `Pensieve.jar` file can be executed (e.g., double-clicked
in Windows) to launch a simple event viewer. From here, you can
load a run file (either current or archived) and browse the events
that have been recorded. This jar file should be executed from
inside the `mods` directory, so that dependencies can be
correctly resolved.

2. You can write a Java program to interrogate a run database
directly. See the 
[Event Viewer](./src/main/java/org/barnhorse/sts/viewer/View.java)
for a relatively simple example.

3. Configure the mod to produce raw JSON output, and inspect the
run files directly. See the "Configuration" details below. You
can also export JSON from the Event Viewer tool. Note that JSON-formatted
run files cannot be loaded back into the viewer tool. Here is a
[sample](./sample/sample.lines) of what the raw JSON output
looks like.

## Mod Configuration
Some minor configuration can be supplied by creating a JSON
file at `mods/etc/barnhorse/pensieve/config.json`.

```
{
    "eventLogDirectory": "path/to/custom/log/directory",
    "archiveDirectory": "/path/to/custom/archive/directory",
    "storageEngine": "FILE" or "NITRITE"; default is NITRITE"
}
```

The only moderately interesting thing you can do here,
currently, is specify `"FILE"` for `storageEngine`. 
This will format the run database in the 
[JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/)
format, which makes direct review possible. Note that the
Event Viewer will not work with run files in this format,
however.

## Events

The current set of events recorded by the mod can be discovered
by exploring the [events](./src/main/java/org/barnhorse/sts/lib/events)
folder. When the mod is more mature, and the event set is more
settled, you'll find more documentation here for individual 
events.
